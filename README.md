app/Http/Controllers/: Handles domain logic (books, copies, transactions).

app/Models/: Laravel Eloquent models mapping to database tables.

database/migrations/: Schema creation and migration scripts.

resources/views/: Blade templates for UI pages.

resources/js/: JavaScript helpers and page-specific logic.

public/: Assets served to the embedded browser.

storage/: Database files and backups.

Database

Location: storage/library.db (created automatically on first run).

Integrity: Checked on app startup; if corrupt, a timestamped backup is saved and DB rebuilt.

Seeding: Departments and courses are created automatically if missing.

Schema highlights:

books holds active metadata and status.

book_copy holds physical copies.

transaction_borrow records borrow/return per copy.

transaction_library records library operations (Add, Edit, Archive, Restore, Delete).

archived_books holds archived book records, including author and publication date.

archived_book_copy holds archived copies.

archived_transaction_borrow keeps historical borrow transactions after archiving.

Archiving Flow

Triggered via LibraryOperations::archiveBook($bookId) (PHP service class).

Updates books.status to Archived.

Inserts into archived_books including book_title, author, publication_date, and archive_date.

Migrates non-borrowed copies from book_copy to archived_book_copy.

Moves completed borrow transactions into archived_transaction_borrow and cleans up.

Logs an Archive operation in transaction_library.

Restoring uses LibraryOperations::restoreArchivedBook($bookId) which reverses the above steps and logs Restore.

Running

Packaged app: Launch the executable under dist/BCULMS/.

Development (optional):

Install PHPDesktop for Windows.

Place Laravel project inside www/ folder of PHPDesktop.

Ensure storage/library.db is writable.

Run php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000 if needed.

Troubleshooting

DB not ready on page load: Ensure queries occur only after Laravel services initialize.

SQLite errors or corruption: On startup, PRAGMA integrity_check is performed; auto-recover if needed via backup and rebuild.

Contributing

Follow existing code style and patterns in app/ and resources/js/.

Use Eloquent models and DB wrapper methods for operations.

Avoid committing secrets; all data is stored locally in SQLite.

If thou wishest, I can also rewrite the folder structure diagram as it would exist in PHPDesktop + Laravel specifically, showing where the HTML, JS, CSS, and SQLite files go for the desktop package.

Dost thou wish me to do that?

can you style it?

Aye, I shall craft it in clean, styled Markdown fit for documentation or README display, with headings, code blocks, lists, and subtle emphasis for clarity. Here is the polished version:

Database

Location: storage/library.db (auto-created on first run).

Integrity: Checked at startup; corrupt DB triggers backup and rebuild.

Seeding: Departments and courses are automatically seeded if missing.

Schema Highlights:

Table	Purpose
books	Active book metadata and status
book_copy	Physical copies of books
transaction_borrow	Borrow/return transactions
transaction_library	Log of library operations (Add/Edit/Archive/Restore/Delete)
archived_books	Archived book records (title, author, publication_date, archive_date)
archived_book_copy	Archived copies
archived_transaction_borrow	Historical borrow transactions
Archiving & Restoring Flow

Archiving:

LibraryOperations::archiveBook($bookId) updates books.status to Archived.

Inserts data into archived_books.

Migrates non-borrowed copies from book_copy → archived_book_copy.

Moves completed borrow transactions → archived_transaction_borrow.

Logs operation in transaction_library.

Restoring:

LibraryOperations::restoreArchivedBook($bookId) reverses the above and logs Restore.

Running the Application

Packaged App:

Launch the executable under dist/BCULMS/.

Development Mode:

Install PHPDesktop.

Place Laravel project in PHPDesktop www/ folder.

Ensure storage/library.db is writable.

Run Laravel locally if needed:

php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000

Troubleshooting

DB not ready on page load: Ensure queries occur only after Laravel initializes services.

SQLite errors or corruption: Integrity is checked at startup. Backup is saved and DB rebuilt automatically.

Contributing

Follow the existing code style in app/ and resources/js/.

Use Eloquent models and database wrapper methods.

Avoid committing secrets; DB is local.
